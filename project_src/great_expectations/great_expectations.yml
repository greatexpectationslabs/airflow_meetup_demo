# Welcome to Great Expectations! Always know what to expect from your data.
# 
# Here you can define datasources, generators, integrations and more. This file
# is intended to be committed to your repo. For help with configuration please:
#   - Read our docs: https://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/0_8_0a3+15_g8cd46e9c/reference/data_context_reference.html#configuration
#   - Join our slack channel: http://greatexpectations.io/slack
#
# NOTE: GE uses the names of configured `datasources` and `generators` to manage
# how `expectations` and other artifacts are stored in the `expectations/` and 
# `datasources/` folders. If you need to rename an existing `datasource` or 
# `generator`, be sure to also update the relevant directory names.

config_version: 1

# Datasources tell Great Expectations where your data lives and how to get it.
# You can use the CLI command `great_expectations add-datasource` to help you
# add a new datasource. Read more at https://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/0_8_0a3+15_g8cd46e9c/features/datasource.html

# This config file supports variable substitution which enables: 1) keeping
# secrets out of source control & 2) environment-based configuration changes
# such as staging vs prod.
#
# When GE encounters substitution syntax (like `my_key: ${my_value}` or 
# `my_key: $my_value`) in the config file it will attempt to replace the value
# of `my_key` with the value from an environment variable `my_value` or a
# corresponding key read from the file specified using
# `config_variables_file_path`. Environment variables take precedence.
#
# If the substitution value comes from the config variables file, it can be a
# simple (non-nested) value or a nested value such as a dictionary. If it comes
# from an environment variable, it must be a simple value. Read more at:
